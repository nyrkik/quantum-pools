# Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26

## Current State

‚úÖ Core routing engine working
‚úÖ Customer/driver management functional
‚úÖ Basic UI operational
üîÑ **In Progress:** SaaS Foundation (Phase 0) - Database migrations and architecture
‚è≥ **Next:** Multi-Module App Framework (Phase 1)

**Critical:** Phase 0 (SaaS Foundation) MUST be completed before Phase 1. We cannot build multi-tenant features on a single-tenant database.

## Phase 5: Lead Generation & Scouting Module (CORE DIFFERENTIATOR)

**Goal:** Automated lead generation through EMD inspection report scraping - the competitive advantage that sets this platform apart

**Why This Matters:** This is THE unique selling proposition. While competitors offer pool service management, we identify NEW business opportunities automatically by scraping public EMD (Environmental Management Department) inspection reports to find pools that aren't being serviced by our customers. This transforms the platform from a passive management tool into an active revenue generator.

See DATABASE_SCHEMA.md for complete scouting schema documentation.

### High-Level Tasks

**5.1 Database Schema (4 tables)**
1. `scraped_reports` - Raw EMD inspection data (facility info, inspection results, violations, metadata)
2. `leads` - Identified unserviced pools with scoring and status tracking
3. `research_data` - Management company information, contact details, enrichment data
4. `scraping_jobs` - Job queue and status tracking for scraping operations

**5.2 EMD Report Scraper**
1. Configurable scraper for California EMD websites (county-specific parsers)
2. Extract facility data: address, pool type, size, violations, last inspection date
3. Geocoding integration (reuse existing provider abstraction)
4. Deduplication logic (match against existing customer addresses)
5. Scheduled scraping jobs (weekly/monthly per organization preferences)
6. Error handling and retry logic
7. Rate limiting and respectful scraping practices

**5.3 Lead Identification Engine**
1. Cross-reference scraped facilities against customer database
2. Identify facilities NOT in customer list (unserviced pools)
3. Lead scoring algorithm:
   - Pool type and size (commercial higher value)
   - Violation severity (urgent repairs = hot leads)
   - Last inspection date (compliance urgency)
   - Geographic proximity to existing routes
   - Estimated revenue potential
4. Filter by organization's service area
5. Mark duplicate leads across time periods

**5.4 Management Company Research**
1. Extract management company names from inspection reports
2. Web scraping for contact information (website, email, phone)
3. Integration with business directory APIs (optional paid service)
4. Store enrichment data (company size, properties managed, contact history)
5. Link multiple facilities to same management company

**5.5 CRM Integration & Sales Workflow**
1. Lead dashboard UI (sortable by score, location, company)
2. Lead assignment to sales team members (role: Owner/Admin)
3. Lead status tracking (new, contacted, qualified, won, lost)
4. Contact history and notes
5. Email templates for outreach
6. Conversion tracking (lead ‚Üí customer)
7. ROI metrics (leads generated, conversion rate, revenue attributed)

**5.6 API Endpoints**
- `/api/v1/scouting/scrape` - Trigger scraping job (manual or scheduled)
- `/api/v1/scouting/reports` - View scraped inspection reports
- `/api/v1/scouting/leads` - List/filter leads with scoring
- `/api/v1/scouting/leads/{id}` - Lead details and research data
- `/api/v1/scouting/leads/{id}/convert` - Convert lead to customer
- `/api/v1/scouting/companies` - Management company directory
- `/api/v1/scouting/jobs` - Scraping job status and history

**5.7 Subscription Tier Integration**
- Starter tier: 50 leads/month
- Professional tier: 200 leads/month
- Enterprise tier: Unlimited leads
- Usage tracking and quota enforcement
- Upgrade prompts when approaching limits

**Dependencies:** Phase 4 complete (water features tables), Phase 0 geocoding abstraction
**Estimated Impact:** 3-4 weeks
**Deliverable:** Automated lead generation engine that identifies new business opportunities from public data

**Success Criteria:**
- Successfully scrape EMD reports from at least 3 California counties
- Identify unserviced pools and score them accurately
- Generate 50+ qualified leads per month for pilot organizations
- Match leads to management companies with contact information
- Provide clear ROI metrics (leads ‚Üí conversions ‚Üí revenue)
- Lead-to-customer conversion workflow fully functional
- Zero data privacy violations (public data only)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- No other pool service software actively generates leads from EMD data
- Transforms platform from cost center (management tool) to profit center (revenue generator)
- Creates network effects (more customers = more served addresses = better lead identification)
- High switching cost once sales pipeline depends on lead flow

## Decision Points

### Immediate Decisions Needed

**Q:** Single-page app (SPA) or multi-page?
**Recommendation:** Start with hash-based SPA routing (simpler, no build step). Can refactor to React/Vue later if needed.

**Q:** Keep vanilla JS or adopt framework?
**Recommendation:** Vanilla JS for Phase 1-3. Consider framework for Phase 4+ when complexity increases.

**Q:** Separate frontend/backend or keep monolithic?
**Recommendation:** Keep monolithic (FastAPI serves static files) for now. Simpler deployment.

### Future Decisions

- Payment gateway choice (Stripe vs Square)
- Email service provider
- File storage solution (local vs S3)
- Framework migration timing
