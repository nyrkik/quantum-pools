#### Complete Product Rebrand
**Priority:** ⭐ High
**Effort:** Large
**Value:** High
**Added:** 2025-10-26

**Description:**
Rebrand from "RouteOptimizer" to new name that reflects comprehensive pool service management platform with scouting/AI differentiators.

**Why:**
Current name is too narrow - doesn't capture scouting (lead generation) and AI features that set us apart. Need name that reflects full platform scope.

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Finalize new product name (naming research paused - needs fresh brainstorming)
2. Rename project directory: `/mnt/Projects/RouteOptimizer` → `/mnt/Projects/[NewName]`
3. Update all documentation files to use new name
4. Update code references (imports, class names, etc.)
5. Update git repository name
6. **Note:** Will require starting new Claude chat after directory rename for proper file access

**Timing:**
- Must happen before public launch
- Can proceed with Phase 0 implementation under current name
- Recommend: Complete before Phase 1 (UI) to avoid UI rework

- Add timestamp
- Suggest category
- Keep it concise - just enough to remember the idea
