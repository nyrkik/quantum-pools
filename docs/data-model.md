# QuantumPools Data Model Reference

Last updated: 2026-04-07

## Overview

- **85 model classes** across 78 files (some files define multiple models)
- **3 additional models** defined outside `models/` (AgentLog, AgentEvalCase, AgentEvalResult in `services/agents/`)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async with `Mapped` / `mapped_column` throughout
- UUID string primary keys (`String(36)`, generated via `uuid.uuid4()`)
- Org-scoped multi-tenancy: nearly every model has `organization_id` FK to `organizations.id`
- All relationships default to `lazy="noload"` — explicit eager loading required
- Timestamps: `created_at` / `updated_at` (UTC) on most models
- 4 legacy alias files (`emd_*.py`) redirect to renamed `inspection_*` models

## Domain Groups

### Core

Platform identity, multi-tenancy, auth, and permissions.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Organization | `organizations` | Tenant (pool service company). Signature fields: `agent_signature` (shared org footer), `auto_signature_prefix` (admin toggle: prepend first_name + org_name), `include_logo_in_signature` (admin toggle: embed logo via CID), `allow_per_user_signature` (admin toggle: honor per-user email_signature/email_signoff; off = absolute consistency), `website_url` (clickable logo target — logo is wrapped in `<a href>` when both are set). |
| User | `users` | Platform user account |
| OrganizationUser | `organization_users` | User-to-org membership with legacy role enum. Signature fields: `email_signature` (per-user personal info, rendered above the org footer), `email_signoff` (optional valediction like "Best,"/"v/r,"/"Cheers," rendered above the name line). |
| UserSession | `user_sessions` | JWT refresh token tracking |
| Permission | `permissions` | 60-slug permission definitions |

|-------|-------|---------|
| Customer | `customers` | Client record (commercial/residential) |
| CustomerContact | `customer_contacts` | Additional contacts per customer |
| CustomerMagicLink | `customer_magic_links` | Single-use 15-min sign-in tokens for the customer-facing portal (Phase 4 V1) |

| PropertyJurisdiction | `property_jurisdictions` | Links property/WF to bather load jurisdiction |
| BatherLoadJurisdiction | `bather_load_jurisdictions` | Jurisdiction-specific bather load calculation rules |

### Service Operations

Routing, visits, checklists, and technician management.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Tech | `techs` | Field technician profile |
| Route | `routes` | Named route (day + tech) |
| RouteStop | `route_stops` | Ordered stop on a route (FK to property) |
| TempTechAssignment | `temp_tech_assignments` | Temporary tech reassignment for a property |
| Visit | `visits` | Single service visit to a property |
| VisitService | `visit_services` | M2M: services performed during a visit |
| VisitPhoto | `visit_photos` | Photos taken during a visit |
| VisitChecklistEntry | `visit_checklist_entries` | Completed checklist items for a visit |
| Service | `services` | Service type catalog (weekly clean, filter clean, etc.) |
| ServiceChecklistItem | `service_checklist_items` | Checklist template items per service type |
| ChemicalReading | `chemical_readings` | Water chemistry readings (pH, chlorine, etc.) |

### Financial

Invoicing, payments, estimates, and charges.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Invoice | `invoices` | Invoice with status tracking. `customer_id` nullable — non-client invoices use `billing_name`/`billing_email`. `payment_token` for public pay page. `internal_notes` for staff-only notes (never exposed to public API). Dunning state on `last_dunning_step_sent` (0=none, 1-4=which step) + `last_dunning_sent_at`. |
| InvoiceLineItem | `invoice_line_items` | Individual line items on an invoice |
| InvoiceRevision | `invoice_revisions` | Audit trail of invoice changes |
| Payment | `payments` | Payment received against an invoice. `customer_id` nullable (non-client). Stripe fields: `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `stripe_charge_id`. |
| ChargeTemplate | `charge_templates` | Reusable charge definitions (e.g. "Filter Clean $85") |
| VisitCharge | `visit_charges` | Ad-hoc charges from a visit |
| EstimateApproval | `estimate_approvals` | Customer estimate with approval/rejection tracking |
| JobInvoice | `job_invoices` | Links jobs (agent actions) to invoices |
| AutopayAttempt | `autopay_attempts` | Tracks autopay charge attempts + retries per invoice |

### Email & Communication

Inbound/outbound email, internal messaging, notifications.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| AgentThread | `agent_threads` | Email conversation thread. `folder_id` → InboxFolder (null = Inbox). `folder_override` prevents rules from re-moving manual assignments. `gmail_thread_id` for Gmail read/unread sync. **Status axis (post-2026-04-25):** `status` is a clean lifecycle field (`pending` → `handled` → `archived`); `update_thread_status` derives `handled` whenever ANY message is sent OR an inbound carries `status='handled'`. `ignored` is no longer derived — present only on legacy rows pending backfill via `app/scripts/migrate_auto_handled_status.py`. **Auto-handled axis** is orthogonal: `auto_handled_at` (sticky) is stamped by the orchestrator at every classifier auto-close, drives the `was_auto_handled` row pill + AI Review virtual folder query (`auto_handled_at IS NOT NULL AND auto_handled_feedback_at IS NULL`); `auto_handled_feedback_at` is the user's Yes/No ack on the in-thread feedback banner (set on every click; non-null suppresses the banner persistently). `auto_read_at` is stamped to `last_message_at` at every auto-handle (and by the `mark_as_read` rule action) so the inbox unread badge stays honest — auto-handled threads don't nag the user. **Visibility axis (post-2026-04-25):** `visibility_role_slugs` (JSONB array of role slugs — built-in `owner`/`admin`/`manager`/`technician`/`readonly` and custom-role slugs) replaces the legacy `visibility_permission`-slug column; null = visible to everyone, otherwise the user's effective role slug must be in the list. Column uses `JSONB(none_as_null=True)` — without that flag, SQLAlchemy serializes Python `None` to JSON `null` (a present value), which `IS NULL` doesn't match, leaving rows invisible to every role. Same gotcha applies to any nullable JSONB column used in `IS NULL` filters. `is_historical` = pre-cutover mail imported by `app/scripts/import_historical_gmail.py`; excluded from triage queries (`list_threads` default + `get_thread_stats`) but included when `customer_id` scopes the query or on the "All Mail" folder. `primary_owner_email` = per-thread owner string (mode of message owners) used by future user-inbox feature. |
| AgentMessage | `agent_messages` | Individual email message in a thread. Has `body` (stripped text), `body_html` (original HTML for rendering), `rfc_message_id` (cross-source dedup), `delivery_status` / `delivered_at` / `first_opened_at` / `open_count` (Postmark webhook tracking). `from_name` = display name parsed from the raw From header at ingest ("American Express" for VERP senders, etc.) — presenter prefers it over the raw email when no customer matched. `received_by_email` = per-message owner derived at ingest from Delivered-To → To → Cc → outbound-From; stable email string, not user_id. |
| MessageAttachment | `message_attachments` | File attachments on agent + internal messages. `is_inline=true` flags MIME parts the body references via `cid:<content_id>` (signature logos, embedded screenshots) — excluded from the user-facing attachments grid; the thread API rewrites `<img src="cid:...">` to `/api/v1/attachments/{id}/file` so the iframe loads them. Outbound `cid:qp-signature-logo` rewrites to `Organization.logo_url` since outbound inline parts aren't persisted as rows. |
| ThreadRead | `thread_reads` | Per-user read tracking for threads |
| InboxRule | `inbox_rules` | Unified sender/recipient rules — JSONB conditions + actions (assign_folder, assign_tag, assign_category, set_visibility, route_to_spam, mark_as_read, suppress_contact_prompt). Evaluated in priority order per message. Replaced both `inbox_routing_rules` and `suppressed_email_senders` (dropped 2026-04-14). |
| BroadcastEmail | `broadcast_emails` | Bulk email campaigns |
| EmailTemplate | `email_templates` | Reusable email templates |
| EmailIntegration | `email_integrations` | Per-org email integration (gmail_api, managed, ms_graph, forwarding, manual). OAuth tokens Fernet-encrypted. |
| InboxFolder | `inbox_folders` | Org-level folders. System folders (is_system=True, seeded per org in sort_order): Inbox (0), **Outbox** (1 — stuck outbound: status queued/failed or delivery_status bounced/spam_complaint or delivery_error set; red badge), Sent (2), Spam (3), **AI Review** (4 — virtual; query is `auto_handled_at IS NOT NULL AND auto_handled_feedback_at IS NULL`, no thread.folder_id ever points here; owner+admin only via `inbox.manage`; amber badge), **All Mail** (5 — escape hatch for live mail regardless of status/folder; gated by `inbox.see_all_mail`), **Historical** (6 — pre-cutover imports, is_historical=True only; same permission). Custom folders nest under Inbox. Threads reference via `agent_threads.folder_id` (null = Inbox). |
| InternalThread | `internal_threads` | Internal team discussion thread |
| InternalMessage | `internal_messages` | Message within an internal thread |
| InternalMessageReaction | `internal_message_reactions` | Per-user emoji reaction on an InternalMessage. Unique on (message_id, user_id, emoji); toggle semantics at the API layer (`POST /v1/messages/reactions/{id}` adds if absent, removes if present). |
| Notification | `notifications` | In-app notification for a user |

### Service Cases

Unified case entity linking threads, jobs, and invoices.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ServiceCase | `service_cases` | Parent case tying together threads, jobs, invoices, internal threads, and DeepBlue conversations for a customer issue. Tracks `manager_name` (coordinator), `current_actor_name` (derived: who needs to act next), `billing_name` (non-DB customers), denormalized counts (`job_count`, `open_job_count`, `thread_count`, `invoice_count`, `internal_thread_count`, `deepblue_conversation_count`), totals (`total_invoiced`, `total_paid`), and 7 attention flags (`flag_estimate_approved`, `flag_estimate_rejected`, `flag_payment_received`, `flag_customer_replied`, `flag_jobs_complete`, `flag_invoice_overdue`, `flag_stale`). All `case_id` writes MUST route through `ServiceCaseService.set_entity_case()` — direct assignment causes count drift. Closed is terminal: once closed, `update_status_from_children` won't re-derive. Cases auto-close when jobs done + invoice sent (payment tracked independently via AR). See `docs/entity-connections-plan.md`. |

### AI Agents & Jobs

Agent actions (jobs), AI learning, and observability.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| AgentAction | `agent_actions` | Job/task created by or for an agent (self-referencing `parent_action_id`). `case_id` is required in practice — `create_action` find-or-creates a case if absent, and the email orchestrator path inherits via thread→case cascade in `ServiceCaseService.set_entity_case`. `closed_by_case_cascade` flags jobs that were auto-closed when the parent case closed, so reopen flows can selectively un-cascade without resurrecting human-completed work. The legacy `is_suggested` + `suggestion_confidence` columns and the `evaluate_next_action` follow-up engine were removed 2026-04-14 — AI suggestions now happen on-demand only, when the user clicks "Add Job" on a thread. |
| AgentActionComment | `agent_action_comments` | Comments on a job |
| AgentActionTask | `agent_action_tasks` | Sub-tasks within a job |
| AgentCorrection | `agent_corrections` | Human corrections to AI outputs (learning data) |
| AgentLog | `agent_logs` | Agent execution observability logs (defined in `services/agents/observability.py`) |
| AgentEvalCase | `agent_eval_cases` | Eval test cases for agents (defined in `services/agents/evals.py`) |
| AgentEvalResult | `agent_eval_results` | Eval run results (defined in `services/agents/evals.py`) |

### DeepBlue (Field AI)

AI assistant for field operations.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| DeepBlueConversation | `deepblue_conversations` | Chat session with DeepBlue |
| DeepBlueMessageLog | `deepblue_message_logs` | Individual messages in a conversation |
| DeepBlueKnowledgeGap | `deepblue_knowledge_gaps` | Questions DeepBlue could not answer (training signal) |
| DeepBlueEvalPrompt | `deepblue_eval_prompts` | Evaluation prompts for DeepBlue quality |
| DeepBlueEvalRun | `deepblue_eval_runs` | Results of evaluation runs |
| DeepBlueUsageMonthly | `deepblue_usage_monthly` | Monthly aggregate usage stats |
| DeepBlueUserUsage | `deepblue_user_usage` | Per-user usage tracking |

### Equipment & Parts

Equipment lifecycle, parts catalog, vendors.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| EquipmentCatalog | `equipment_catalog` | Canonical equipment database (114 entries) |
| EquipmentItem | `equipment_items` | Installed equipment instance on a water feature. `install_date` = when it was placed in service (PRX filter cartridge age, warranty windows, etc.). `system_group` groups multi-pump/filter systems so a cartridge is associated with a specific pump. Both are populated via the WF equipment edit sheet on customer detail. |
| EquipmentEvent | `equipment_events` | Lifecycle events (install, repair, replace) |
| PartsCatalog | `parts_catalog` | Parts database (434 entries, linked to equipment) |
| PartPurchase | `part_purchases` | Purchase records for parts |
| Vendor | `vendors` | Supplier/vendor records |

### Profitability & Chemical Costs

Cost analysis and pricing optimization.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| OrgCostSettings | `org_cost_settings` | Org-wide cost defaults (labor rate, truck cost, overhead) |
| OrgChemicalPrices | `org_chemical_prices` | Org-level chemical pricing |
| ChemicalCostProfile | `chemical_cost_profiles` | Per-WF chemical cost profile |
| DimensionEstimate | `dimension_estimates` | AI-estimated pool dimensions |

### Pool Analysis

Satellite imagery and measurement tools.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| SatelliteAnalysis | `satellite_analyses` | Per-WF satellite analysis (sqft, vegetation, obstructions). Unique FK to `water_features.id` |
| PoolMeasurement | `pool_measurements` | Ground-truth measurements from tech photos + Claude Vision |

### Inspections (Pool Scout Pro)

Health department inspection intelligence. Sacramento County is the **only** California county with an online portal we can scrape.

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| InspectionFacility | `inspection_facilities` | A `(EMD establishment FA####, program_identifier)` row. ONE EMD establishment can have multiple rows distinguished by `program_identifier` (POOL/SPA at the same address, or `POOL @ 4407 OAK HOLLOW DR` vs `POOL @ 4440 OAK HOLLOW DR` for one establishment with two physical buildings — the Arbor Ridge case). Composite unique `(facility_id, program_identifier) NULLS NOT DISTINCT`. |
| Inspection | `inspections` | Individual inspection record. Has `permit_url` so the daily scraper's permit-walker can find multi-BoW siblings the date listing collapses. |
| InspectionViolation | `inspection_violations` | Violations found during an inspection |
| InspectionEquipment | `inspection_equipment` | Equipment recorded during an inspection |
| InspectionLookup | `inspection_lookups` | Single-lookup purchase records (tier-gated) |
| ScraperRun | `scraper_runs` | Playwright scraper execution log |

## Deprecated Fields

These fields exist for backward compatibility but should NOT be read for display or business logic.

### Property (legacy pool fields)
The following columns on `properties` are superseded by `WaterFeature`:
- `pool_type`, `pool_shape`, `pool_length`, `pool_width`, `pool_depth_shallow`, `pool_depth_deep`
- `pool_gallons`, `pool_sqft`, `pool_volume_method`
- `pump_type`, `filter_type`, `heater_type`, `chlorinator_type`, `automation_system`

Read pool dimensions from `water_features`. Read equipment from `equipment_items` via `water_features.id`.

### AgentThread / AgentAction (denormalized customer name)
- `customer_name` on `agent_threads` and `agent_actions` is a fallback for unmatched records only
- When `matched_customer_id` / `customer_id` exists, join to `customers` table for display

---

## Known Issues

- ~~Duplicate PaymentMethod enum~~ — **FIXED 2026-04-07**: centralized in `core/enums.py`, both models re-export
- ~~Missing Tech.routes relationship~~ — **FIXED 2026-04-07**: bidirectional `back_populates` added
- **OrgRole name collision**: `OrgRole` exists as both an enum in `organization_user.py` and a model class in `org_role.py`. The enum is the legacy role system; the model is the new granular permission system.
- **Deprecated Property columns still exist**: 16 pool/equipment columns on Property model. Schemas no longer accept writes (fixed 2026-04-07) but columns remain for backward-compat reads.

---

## Conventions

| Pattern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Primary keys | `String(36)` UUIDs, generated in Python (`uuid.uuid4()`), not DB-level |
| Org scoping | `organization_id: String(36) FK organizations.id` on nearly every model |
| Timestamps | `created_at` (server default `func.now()`), `updated_at` (nullable, set on update) |
| Relationships | `lazy="noload"` everywhere — must explicitly `selectinload()` / `joinedload()` |
| Soft delete | Not used — records are hard-deleted (except customers which use `status` enum) |
| Enums | Python `str, enum.Enum` subclasses stored as `String` columns (not PG enum type) |
| Defaults | Defined in SQLAlchemy model only — NOT at PostgreSQL column level. Raw SQL must provide all values. |
| Cascade | `ondelete="CASCADE"` on child FKs to org/parent; `ondelete="SET NULL"` on optional references |
| Table naming | Plural snake_case (e.g. `water_features`, `agent_threads`) |
