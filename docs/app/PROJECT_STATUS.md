- app.js reduced from 3,516 lines to 108 lines

### In Progress

**ðŸ”„ Multi-Tenancy Foundation**
- Database schema designed (organizations, users, organization_users)
- Authentication/authorization patterns defined
- Migration to add organization_id to all tables
- Service layer refactoring for automatic org scoping

### Next Steps (Priority Order)

**1. Complete Multi-Tenancy Migration**
- [ ] Create migration: add organization_id to all tenant tables
- [ ] Add foreign key constraints
- [ ] Create indexes on organization_id columns
- [ ] Seed initial test organization
- [ ] Run migration on dev database

**2. Implement Authentication**
- [ ] Create auth endpoints (register, login, logout)
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Auth middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Frontend login/logout UI

**3. Organization Scoping**
- [ ] Add get_current_user dependency
- [ ] Refactor all API endpoints to include org_id filter
- [ ] Update service layer methods
- [ ] Add organization context tests
- [ ] Verify data isolation

**4. Role-Based Access Control**
- [ ] Implement permission checking
- [ ] Create role decorators
- [ ] Add UI role-based visibility
- [ ] Test permission matrix

**5. User Management**
- [ ] Organization settings page
- [ ] Invite users to organization
- [ ] Assign/change user roles
- [ ] Deactivate users

## Technical Debt

**None** - Refactoring complete, clean codebase

## Known Issues

**None** - All bugs fixed before moving forward

## Performance Metrics

**Frontend:**
- Initial page load: <2s
- Route optimization: 3-8s (depends on customer count)
- Map rendering: <1s

**Backend:**
- Customer list API: <200ms
- Route optimization API: 3-8s
- Geocoding (cached): <50ms

## Environment

**Development:**
- Server: localhost:7007
- Database: PostgreSQL (local)
- Frontend: Vanilla JS + Leaflet
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0

**Production:** Not deployed yet

## Team

**Solo Developer:** Brian (with AI assistance)

## Timeline

**Phase 1 (Complete):** Core MVP features
**Phase 2 (Current):** Multi-tenancy & auth (Est. 2-3 weeks)
**Phase 3 (Next):** Service tracking & billing (Est. 4-6 weeks)
**Phase 4 (Future):** Mobile app, advanced features
