# Claude Code - Command Reference

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

Quick command reference for streamlined development workflow with Claude Code.

---

## Commit Commands

### `commit` or `commit-go`
Commit changes with descriptive message, **push to GitHub**, update SESSION_LOG.md, and continue working.

**Usage:**
```
User: commit
```

**What happens:**
1. Git status and diff review
2. Staged files committed with detailed message
3. **Pushed to GitHub (cloud backup)**
4. SESSION_LOG.md updated with progress
5. TodoWrite updated
6. Continues to next task automatically

**Why auto-push:**
- Immediate cloud backup (protects against data loss)
- Solo developer workflow (no team coordination needed)
- Network required anyway (Claude needs internet)

---

### `commit-pause`
Commit changes, **push to GitHub**, and pause for your review/input before continuing.

**Usage:**
```
User: commit-pause
```

**What happens:**
1. Same as `commit` (steps 1-5)
2. Stops and waits for your next instruction

**Use when:**
- Want to review changes before continuing
- Need to test manually before next step
- Switching context to different task

---

### `commit-local`
Commit changes WITHOUT pushing to GitHub (rare use).

**Usage:**
```
User: commit-local
```

**What happens:**
1. Git status and diff review
2. Staged files committed with detailed message
3. SESSION_LOG.md updated with progress
4. TodoWrite updated
5. **No push to GitHub** (stays local only)
6. Continues to next task automatically

**Use when:**
- Testing risky changes you might want to undo
- Experimenting with something you're not ready to backup
- Working offline (rare since Claude needs internet)

---

**Usage:**
```

## Command Aliases

Some commands have shortcuts:

| Command | Alias |
|---------|-------|
| `commit-go` | `commit` |
| `tasks` | `todo` |
| `help` | `list` |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### When to Use Commands

**During active development:**
- Use `commit` frequently (every logical checkpoint)
- Use `backlog: [idea]` to capture ideas without losing focus
- Use `test` before committing major changes

**When stuck or context switching:**
- Use `where` to regain context
- Use `status` or `roadmap` to see big picture
- Use `files` to find relevant code

**Before ending session:**
- Always `commit-pause` to save progress
- Use `todo` to see what's left
- Use `next` to plan next session

### Command Composition

You can use multiple commands in one message:
```
User: test, then commit-pause
User: review, and if it looks good, commit
User: where are we, and what's next?
```

---

## Future Commands (Ideas)

These don't exist yet but might be useful:

- `refactor [file]` - Suggest refactoring opportunities
- `optimize` - Performance optimization suggestions
- `security` - Security audit of recent changes
- `coverage` - Test coverage report
- `bench` - Run benchmarks
- `deploy` - Deploy to staging/production

Add these to BACKLOG.md if you want them!

---

**For Claude Code instances:**
When user uses these commands, execute the documented behavior immediately without asking for confirmation (unless specified otherwise).

**For users:**
These commands are designed to minimize interruptions and keep you in flow state. Use them freely!
