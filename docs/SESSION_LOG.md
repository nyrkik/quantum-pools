## 2025-10-26: Authentication System & Bug Fixes

### Goal
Fix customer loading issues after driver→tech refactor and implement authentication system for browser access.

### Issues Found & Fixed

**Backend Bug: Customer API Crash**
- `AttributeError: 'Customer' has no attribute 'assigned_driver'` in customers.py
- Root cause: Incomplete driver→tech refactor left old relationship names
- Fixed by updating `Customer.assigned_driver` → `Customer.assigned_tech` (lines 105, 207)

**Data Migration Issue**
- Customers returned empty despite API working
- Root cause: Customers belonged to Demo Organization (cc162b59...) but auth token was for Test Organization (80539fb3...)
- Fixed by migrating 79 customers and 2 techs to correct organization via SQL

**Authentication Missing**
- Browser requests returned 403 Forbidden - no authentication system existed
- User had never set a password (authentication was newly added)

**JavaScript Syntax Errors**
- `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'` in bulk-edit.js:241 and customers.js:331
- Root cause: sed command `s/await fetch(/await Auth.apiRequest(/g` incorrectly matched patterns inside template literals
- `${fetch.id}` became `${Auth.apiRequest.id}` which was further corrupted to `${.tech.id}`
- Fixed by correcting template literals: `${.tech.id}` → `${tech.id}`

### Implementation Completed

**✅ Authentication System**
- Created `/static/login.html` - modern login UI with gradient background
- Created `/static/js/auth.js` - authentication utility with:
  - Token storage in localStorage
  - Automatic redirect if unauthenticated
  - Auth.apiRequest() wrapper for authenticated API calls
  - Auth.requireAuth() for protected pages
  - Logout functionality
- Modified `/static/index.html`:
  - Added auth.js script loading
  - Added Auth.requireAuth() call on page load
  - Added logout button to sidebar
- Updated all JavaScript modules to use Auth.apiRequest() instead of raw fetch()
- Set bcrypt password hash for testorg@example.com (password: "password123")

**✅ Files Modified**
- `app/api/customers.py` - Fixed assigned_tech relationship references
- `static/login.html` - Created
- `static/js/auth.js` - Created
- `static/index.html` - Added auth integration and logout button
- `static/js/modules/bulk-edit.js` - Fixed template literal syntax error
- `static/js/modules/customers.js` - Fixed template literal syntax error
- All JS modules (navigation, map, modals, techs, routes, customers, bulk-edit) - Updated to use Auth.apiRequest()

### Key Decisions

**Authentication Approach:**
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage (simple, works for SPA)
- Bearer token authentication via Authorization header
- Automatic logout and redirect on 401 responses
- Alternative considered: Cookies with HttpOnly (rejected for simplicity in MVP)

**Password Management:**
- Set initial password via bcrypt hash directly in database
- Future: Add password reset and user profile management UI

**Error Handling:**
- Used sed for bulk fetch→Auth.apiRequest replacement (caused template literal issues)
- Lesson learned: sed replacements can break template literals - use more targeted approach or manual edits
- Fixed by identifying all syntax errors with `node --check`

### Testing Results
- ✅ Backend API returns 79 customers with authentication
- ✅ Login flow works: email/password → JWT token → redirect to app
- ✅ All JavaScript files have valid syntax (verified with node --check)
- ✅ Auth.apiRequest() properly adds Authorization headers
- ✅ Logout clears tokens and redirects to login

### Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. User tests browser login and customer loading
2. Shift focus to routing optimization (user's operational priority)

**Future:**
- Add user profile management
- Implement password reset flow
- Add "Remember me" functionality
- Consider refresh token implementation

**Usage Tips:**
- Update after each `commit` (Claude does this automatically)
- Focus on **why** decisions were made, not just what
- Record alternatives considered and rejected
- Document blockers and how they were resolved
- Keep it concise - detailed docs go in ARCHITECTURE.md or FEATURES.md
