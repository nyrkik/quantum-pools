# DeepBlue Field — Architecture

DeepBlue is QuantumPools' in-app AI assistant. It's a tool-using agent with persistent conversations, cost controls, and a knowledge-gap learning loop.

## Overview

DeepBlue has three UI surfaces:
1. **Floating button** — ephemeral quick lookups on any page
2. **Bottom sheet** — expands from the button, drawer view with history
3. **Full page** (`/deepblue`) — ChatGPT-style sidebar + chat for longer work

Conversations are persisted server-side and can be private, shared with the team, or case-linked.

## Schema

### Core table: `deepblue_conversations`

Primary entity. One row per conversation (which may contain many messages).

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| id | String(36) PK | UUID |
| organization_id | FK → organizations | Org scoping |
| user_id | FK → users | Creator/owner |
| case_id | FK → service_cases (nullable) | If case-linked, always visible to case viewers |
| context_json | Text (JSON) | `{customer_id, property_id, bow_id, visit_id}` at creation time |
| title | String(200) | Auto-generated from first message |
| messages_json | Text (JSON array) | Full message history with tool blocks |
| model_tier | String(20) | `fast` (Haiku) or `standard` (Sonnet) |
| total_input_tokens | Integer | Cumulative for conversation |
| total_output_tokens | Integer | Cumulative |
| visibility | String(20) | `private` | `shared` | `case` |
| pinned | Boolean | Owner's pin flag |
| deleted_at | DateTime (nullable) | Soft delete timestamp |
| shared_at | DateTime (nullable) | When visibility changed to shared |
| shared_by | String(36) | User who shared |

### Per-turn logging: `deepblue_message_logs`

One row per assistant turn. Anomaly detection foundation.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| id | PK | UUID |
| organization_id | FK | |
| user_id | FK | |
| conversation_id | String(36) | Links to conversation (not FK for retention resilience) |
| message_index | Integer | Position in conversation |
| input_tokens | Integer | |
| output_tokens | Integer | |
| total_tokens | Integer | |
| tool_calls_made | Text (JSON array) | Tools invoked this turn |
| tool_count | Integer | Denormalized count |
| user_prompt_hash | String(32) | SHA-256 for pattern detection without storing prompts |
| user_prompt_length | Integer | |
| response_length | Integer | |
| latency_ms | Integer | End-to-end time |
| category | String(30) | `pool_service` | `business_ops` | `off_topic` | `unknown` |
| off_topic_detected | Boolean | Relevance flag |
| model_used | String(20) | |
| created_at | DateTime (indexed) | 90-day retention |

### Daily user rollup: `deepblue_user_usage`

Denormalized daily aggregates for quota enforcement.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| user_id + date | Unique key |
| message_count | |
| input_tokens, output_tokens | |
| tool_calls_count | |
| off_topic_count | |

### Monthly cost rollup: `deepblue_usage_monthly`

Survives conversation retention cleanup. Preserves cost data indefinitely.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| organization_id + user_id + year + month | Unique key |
| conversations_created, messages_sent | |
| total_input_tokens, total_output_tokens | |
| total_cost_usd_estimated | Rolled up at retention hard-delete time |

### Knowledge gaps: `deepblue_knowledge_gaps`

When the meta-tool (`query_database`) is used or DeepBlue says "I don't know," a gap is logged. Reviewed weekly to decide which new tools to build.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| user_question | Original prompt |
| resolution | `meta_tool` | `unresolved` |
| sql_query | SQL used if meta_tool |
| reason | Claude's stated reason for meta-tool use |
| result_row_count | |
| reviewed | Admin flag |
| promoted_to_tool | Tool name if promoted |

```

## Cost controls

Four enforcement layers, all in `quota_service.py`:

1. **Rate limit** — Redis counter, per-user per-minute. Default 30/min. Fails open if Redis is down.
2. **User daily quota** — checked against `deepblue_user_usage` row for today. Defaults: 500K input tokens, 100K output tokens.
3. **User monthly quota** — sum of last 30 days. Defaults: 5M input, 1M output.
4. **Org monthly quota** — sum across all users, last 30 days. Defaults: 50M input, 10M output.

Quotas are configurable per org on the `organizations` table.

## Retention policy

Managed by `retention_service.py`:

| Data | Lifetime | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| `deepblue_conversations` (private, unpinned, no case) | 90 days inactive → soft delete | |
| soft-deleted conversations | +30 days → hard delete | Rolls up to `deepblue_usage_monthly` first |
| `deepblue_message_logs` | 90 days | Purged |
| `deepblue_knowledge_gaps` | 90 days | Purged |
| case-linked conversations | never | Case lifecycle |
| shared conversations | never | Manual unshare or delete |
| pinned conversations | never | Manual unpin or delete |

Cleanup triggered via `POST /v1/deepblue/retention/run` (owner only). Future: APScheduler cron.

## Tool-use loop

`engine.py:DeepBlueEngine.process_message()` implements the agent loop:

```
1. Quota check (fails fast if exceeded)
2. Build context (org profile + page context IDs → rich text)
3. Load or create conversation
4. Reconstruct claude_messages from messages_history (text + structured blocks)
5. Loop (max 5 rounds):
     a. Call Claude with system prompt + tools + messages
     b. For each content block in response:
          - text: stream to client, append to assistant turn
          - tool_use: execute tool, stream result, append to turn
     c. If no tools called, exit loop
     d. Otherwise append tool_results as user message, loop again
6. Persist conversation (text + structured blocks for next-turn fidelity)
7. Log to message_logs, user_usage, knowledge_gaps
8. Yield done event
```

Max 5 tool-use rounds per turn prevents runaway loops. Per-turn counter in `ToolContext` also caps parts searches at 3 per turn.

## Tools (as of 2026-04-05)

### Knowledge (auto-execute, no confirmation)
- `chemical_dosing_calculator` — deterministic, wraps `dosing_engine.py`. Never AI math.
- `get_organization_info` — org profile (also in baseline context)

### Lookup (auto-execute)
- `get_agent_health` — agent metrics, failures, per-agent breakdown (wraps agent-ops observability)
- `find_customer` — fuzzy search customers (ILIKE + pg_trgm fallback)
- `find_property` — fuzzy search properties with BOW details
- `get_equipment` — equipment on a property/BOW
- `get_chemical_history` — recent readings
- `get_service_history` — visits
- `get_customer_info` — full customer detail
- `find_replacement_parts` — catalog + web search, supports compare_retailers mode
- `search_equipment_catalog` — shared catalog search
- `get_billing_documents` — invoices + estimates merged tool
- `get_open_jobs` — agent_actions
- `get_cases` — service cases
- `get_routes_today` — today's routes per tech
- `get_techs` — active techs
- `get_billing_terms` — org cost settings
- `get_service_tiers` — residential tier packages
- `get_inspections` — health dept inspection history for a property
- `get_payments` — payment history

### Meta
- `query_database` — read-only SELECT with 6-layer safety stack (sqlparse validator, table whitelist, org-scope enforcement, row limit, timeout, read-only transaction)

### Action (requires preview + confirm)
- `draft_broadcast_email` — bulk email with recipient filters (all_active, commercial, residential, custom, test)
- `add_equipment_to_pool` — adds equipment_items row
- `log_chemical_reading` — adds chemical_readings row
- `update_customer_note` — appends to customers.notes

Each action tool returns a preview; the frontend renders a confirmation card; user taps confirm → dedicated `POST /confirm-*` endpoint executes the write.

## Visibility model

Three states:

| State | Who can see | Who can modify |
|---|---|---|
| private (default) | Owner only | Owner |
| shared | Everyone in the org | Owner only |
| case (case_id set) | Anyone who can view the case | Owner only |

Shared conversations are read-only for non-owners. "Fork" creates a private copy for the viewer to continue.

Pin is owner-only today. Future: per-user pin table if shared chats need personal bookmarking.

## UI entry points

- **Floating button** (`components/deepblue/deepblue-trigger.tsx`) — bottom-right on all pages
- **Bottom sheet** (`components/deepblue/deepblue-sheet.tsx`) — opens from trigger, contains history drawer
- **Full page** (`app/(dashboard)/deepblue/page.tsx`) — ChatGPT-style layout with sidebar
- **Case card** (`components/deepblue/case-deepblue-card.tsx`) — embedded in case detail right column, persistent per case
- **Dashboard card** — "Recent DeepBlue Chats" on main dashboard links to `/deepblue?id=...`

## Admin pages

- `/settings/deepblue-usage` — token usage, cost estimates, per-user breakdown with anomaly highlighting

## Design decisions

**Why persist tool results in conversation history?**
Without tool results, resuming a conversation loses fidelity. Claude only sees its own text summary of prior tool outputs. With structured blocks persisted, the full raw data survives across turns — so "find parts for the pump we discussed" can reference exact model numbers seen in a prior `get_equipment` call.

**Why separate tables for each DeepBlue concern?**
- `deepblue_conversations`: primary entity, the chat itself
- `deepblue_message_logs`: per-turn analytics, separate lifecycle from conversations (90-day purge regardless)
- `deepblue_user_usage`: daily rollup for fast quota checks (avoids scanning message_logs)
- `deepblue_usage_monthly`: preserves cost data when conversations are retention-purged
- `deepblue_knowledge_gaps`: learning loop, independent of conversation retention

Each table has a single responsibility. Mixing them would create schema drift and coupling.

**Why a meta-tool (`query_database`)?**
Covers the long tail of data questions without requiring a new tool for every possibility. Hard-secured with 6 defense layers. Every use is logged to `deepblue_knowledge_gaps` so repeated patterns can be promoted to dedicated tools.

**Why trigram similarity for search?**
User typos and variant spellings ("walili" vs "walali") broke exact ILIKE searches. pg_trgm provides typo-tolerant fallback with a 0.3 similarity threshold. Primary search is still exact ILIKE for speed; trigram only runs when exact returns nothing.

## Related systems

### Agent health monitoring
Not part of DeepBlue per se, but feeds into it via `get_agent_health` tool.
- `src/services/agents/health_monitor.py` — threshold-based alerting on `agent_logs`
- `POST /v1/agent-ops/health-check` — manual trigger (cron hook later)
- Fires `type=agent_health` notifications to owners/admins with 60-minute dedup
- Thresholds: success rate < 90% (24h), ≥3 failures/hour per agent, ≥10 failures/hour org-wide
- DeepBlue users can ask "how are the agents doing?" and get the same data conversationally
- See `memory/plan-agent-anomaly-detection.md` for the future upgrade path to baseline-based detection

## Future work

- APScheduler job to run retention cleanup daily (currently manual)
- APScheduler job to run agent health checks every 15 min (currently manual via endpoint)
- Anomaly detection upgrade for agent health (see memory plan doc)
- Per-user pins table (`deepblue_user_pins`) if shared chats need personal bookmarks
- CC capture for inbound emails + multi-sender contact learning (unrelated to DeepBlue but will affect customer matching which DeepBlue relies on)
- Voice input (Web Speech API)
- Offline service worker + static dosing reference tables
