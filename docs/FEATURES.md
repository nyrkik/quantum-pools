## Lead Generation & Scouting Module üéØ (Phase 5 - Core Differentiator)

**THE competitive advantage - transforms platform from cost center to profit center**

### EMD Inspection Report Scraping
- Automated web scraping of California EMD (Environmental Management Department) websites
- County-specific parsers for varied website formats
- Extract facility data: address, pool type, size, violations, last inspection date
- Scheduled scraping jobs (weekly/monthly per organization preference)
- Geocoding integration (reuses existing provider abstraction)
- Rate limiting and respectful scraping practices
- Error handling and retry logic
- Scraping job queue and status tracking

### Lead Identification Engine
- Cross-reference scraped facilities against customer database
- Identify unserviced pools (facilities NOT in customer list)
- Lead scoring algorithm:
  - Pool type and size (commercial pools = higher value)
  - Violation severity (urgent repairs = hot leads)
  - Last inspection date (compliance urgency)
  - Geographic proximity to existing routes
  - Estimated revenue potential
- Filter by organization's service area
- Deduplication across time periods
- Mark duplicate leads

### Management Company Research
- Extract management company names from inspection reports
- Web scraping for contact information (website, email, phone)
- Integration with business directory APIs (optional paid service)
- Enrichment data storage (company size, properties managed, contact history)
- Link multiple facilities to same management company
- Contact history and relationship tracking

### CRM Integration & Sales Workflow
- Lead dashboard UI (sortable by score, location, company)
- Lead assignment to sales team members (role: Owner/Admin)
- Lead status tracking: new, contacted, qualified, won, lost
- Contact history and notes
- Email templates for outreach
- Conversion tracking (lead ‚Üí customer)
- ROI metrics dashboard:
  - Leads generated per month
  - Conversion rate percentage
  - Revenue attributed to scouting
  - Management companies identified
  - Time-to-close metrics

### Subscription Tier Integration
- **Starter tier:** 50 leads/month
- **Professional tier:** 200 leads/month
- **Enterprise tier:** Unlimited leads
- Usage tracking and quota enforcement
- Upgrade prompts when approaching limits
- Lead generation history and analytics

### Database Tables
- `scraped_reports` - Raw EMD inspection data with metadata
- `leads` - Identified unserviced pools with scoring and status
- `research_data` - Management company information and enrichment
- `scraping_jobs` - Job queue and status tracking

### API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/scouting/scrape` - Trigger scraping job (manual or scheduled)
- `/api/v1/scouting/reports` - View scraped inspection reports
- `/api/v1/scouting/leads` - List/filter leads with scoring
- `/api/v1/scouting/leads/{id}` - Lead details and research data
- `/api/v1/scouting/leads/{id}/convert` - Convert lead to customer
- `/api/v1/scouting/companies` - Management company directory
- `/api/v1/scouting/jobs` - Scraping job status and history

### Competitive Advantage
- **Unique in market:** No other pool service software generates leads from EMD data
- **Revenue generator:** Turns management tool into active business development tool
- **Network effects:** More customers = more served addresses = better lead identification
- **High switching cost:** Sales pipeline becomes dependent on lead flow
- **Scalable:** Automated scraping scales to multiple counties/states
