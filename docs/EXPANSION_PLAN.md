# Expansion Plan: Comprehensive Pool Service Platform

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26

## Vision

Transform from route optimization tool into **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for pool service business management with **two core differentiators** that set us apart from all competitors:

### THE Competitive Advantages
1. **ðŸŽ¯ Lead Generation & Scouting** - Automated EMD inspection report scraping identifies unserviced pools and management companies. Transforms platform from cost center (management tool) into profit center (revenue generator). NO other pool service software does this.

2. **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Intelligence** - Machine learning recommendations for routing, maintenance prediction, churn prevention, pricing optimization, and automated insights. Goes beyond basic management to proactive business intelligence.

### Complete Feature Set
- **Lead Generation & Scouting** (Phase 5) - THE unique selling proposition
- **AI-Powered Features** (Phase 9+) - THE intelligence layer
- **SaaS Foundation** (Phase 0) - Authentication, multi-tenancy, billing
- Route optimization with Google OR-Tools (current core feature)
- Water features & pool management (Title 22 compliance)
- Job tracking & work orders
- Invoicing & billing with Stripe integration
- Estimates & proposals with conversion workflow
- Customer management (enhanced with lead conversion)
- Team management (enhanced with role-based permissions)
- Inventory tracking (potential Phase 10+)
- Customer portal (potential Phase 10+)

**Philosophy:** Build with enterprise scalability from day one. Every module production-ready, no shortcuts. Multi-tenant architecture from the foundation. Lead generation and AI are not afterthoughts - they are THE strategic differentiators built into the architecture from the start.

## Current State

**Implemented:**
- Route optimization engine
- Customer management
- Driver/team management
- Basic scheduling

**In Progress (Phase 0 - SaaS Foundation):**
- Multi-tenant architecture (organizations + users)
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- Subscription billing infrastructure
- Map provider abstraction
- API versioning (/api/v1/)

**Immediate Focus:**
- Complete Phase 0 (SaaS Foundation) - database migrations, auth system, multi-tenancy
- Then proceed to routing module UI refinement (Phase 1)
- Build foundation for multi-module app

## SaaS Business Model

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Core Principle:** Single codebase serves multiple pool service companies (organizations) with complete data isolation.

**Organization = Customer:**
- Each pool service company is an "organization"
- Organizations have multiple users with different roles
- Complete data isolation via `organization_id` on all tenant-specific tables
- Per-organization configuration (geocoding provider, feature flags, billing)

**User Roles & Permissions:**
1. **Owner** - Full access, billing management, can delete organization
2. **Admin** - Manage users, all CRUD operations, cannot manage billing
3. **Manager** - Create/edit routes, customers, drivers
4. **Technician** - View routes, mark visits complete, read-only on customers
5. **Readonly** - View-only access to all data

See [SAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md](SAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete RBAC specification.
